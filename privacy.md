<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Last Updated: February 18, 2026</p>

BumpTrackr is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.

## The Short Version

**We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal data.** Everything stays on your device and your personal iCloud account.

## Information We Collect

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### We Collect Nothing

BumpTrackr does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. The app operates entirely on your device and your private iCloud account.

- No accounts or sign-ups required
- No analytics or tracking SDKs
- No advertising frameworks
- No server-side data storage

</div>

## Data Stored on Your Device

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Local Data Only

The following information is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework and UserDefaults:

- **Pregnancy details:** Due date, baby name, baby gender
- **Delivery details:** Birth date, baby weight, baby length (after delivery)
- **Your name:** Used for personalized greetings and to label entries in partner sync
- **Checklist items:** Your to-do items and completion status
- **Appointments:** Prenatal and pediatrician visit dates and details
- **Symptom logs:** Symptoms, kick counts, contraction timing, and postpartum recovery logs
- **Birth plan:** Your birth preferences and care team details
- **Critical info:** Emergency contacts and hospital information
- **Notes and milestones:** Personal journal entries and photos
- **App preferences:** Theme, notification preference level, delivery status

</div>

## iCloud Sync

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Apple iCloud & CloudKit

BumpTrackr uses Apple's CloudKit framework to sync your pregnancy data across your own devices via your personal iCloud account. This means:

- **Your data is stored in your iCloud account** — we cannot access it
- **Data is encrypted in transit and at rest** by Apple's infrastructure
- **We do not operate any servers** — Apple handles all cloud storage
- **iCloud sync can be disabled** by turning off iCloud for the app in your device Settings

Apple's [iCloud Terms of Service](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) govern how your iCloud data is handled.

</div>

## Partner Sharing

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Shared Tracker

You can optionally share your pregnancy tracker with a partner (e.g., a co-parent or support person) via iCloud. When you share:

- **Only explicitly invited participants** can access the shared data — the share link alone does not grant access
- Shared data includes checklist items, appointments, symptom logs, milestones, birth plan, baby shower details, and critical contacts
- **Photos and journal notes are not synced** — they remain private on each device
- **Each entry is labeled** with who logged it (your display name)
- **The owner controls access** and can remove a partner at any time
- **Sharing can be revoked** at any time, which immediately removes the partner's access
- Partner sharing uses Apple's CloudKit sharing infrastructure — we have no visibility into shared data

</div>

## Notifications

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Push Notifications

BumpTrackr can send local notifications for weekly pregnancy tips, appointment reminders, and milestone alerts. These notifications are:

- **Generated entirely on your device** — no push notification servers are involved
- **Controlled by you** — choose from three levels (Minimal, Balanced, Everything) or disable entirely
- Customizable at any time in Settings

No notification data is transmitted off your device.

</div>

## Calendar Access

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Calendar Integration

If you choose to sync appointments with your device calendar, the app uses Apple's EventKit framework to create calendar events. This requires your explicit permission and only writes events you choose to add. We do not read or access other calendar entries.

</div>

## Photo Access

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Photo Library

If you attach photos to milestones or notes, the app accesses your photo library with your permission. Photos are stored locally within the app's data container and are **not uploaded or synced** — they remain private on your device.

</div>

## Data Backup & Export

The app includes a built-in backup feature that exports your data as a JSON file. This file is created locally and shared only through methods you choose (AirDrop, Files, email, etc.). We never see or access these backups.

## Third-Party Services

**We use zero third-party services.** No analytics (no Firebase, no Mixpanel), no crash reporting, no advertising networks, no server APIs. The app is entirely self-contained. The only external service used is Apple's iCloud, which is managed by your Apple account.

## Children's Privacy

BumpTrackr is designed for expecting parents and their support partners. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Data about pregnancy and newborn care is stored locally on the parent's device and in their personal iCloud account.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device and in your personal iCloud account, it is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, and device encryption) and Apple's iCloud encryption. We recommend keeping your device software up to date.

## Data Deletion

- **Delete the app** to remove all locally stored data
- **iCloud data** can be managed via Settings &rarr; Apple Account &rarr; iCloud &rarr; Manage Storage
- **Shared data** is removed when the owner revokes sharing or deletes the share

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
