<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Last Updated: February 7, 2026</p>

BumpTrackr is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.

## The Short Version

**We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal data.** Everything stays on your device.

## Information We Collect

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### We Collect Nothing

BumpTrackr does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. The app operates entirely on your device.

- No accounts or sign-ups required
- No analytics or tracking SDKs
- No advertising frameworks
- No server-side data storage

</div>

## Data Stored on Your Device

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Local Data Only

The following information is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework and UserDefaults:

- **Pregnancy details:** Due date, baby name, baby gender
- **Delivery details:** Birth date, baby weight, baby length (after delivery)
- **Your name:** Used for personalized greetings within the app
- **Checklist items:** Your to-do items and completion status
- **Appointments:** Prenatal and pediatrician visit dates and details
- **Symptom logs:** Symptoms, kick counts, contraction timing, and postpartum recovery logs
- **Birth plan:** Your birth preferences and care team details
- **Critical info:** Emergency contacts and hospital information
- **Notes and milestones:** Personal journal entries and photos
- **App preferences:** Theme, notification preference level, delivery status

This data is **never transmitted** off your device. If you delete the app, this data is permanently removed.

</div>

## Notifications

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Push Notifications

BumpTrackr can send local notifications for weekly pregnancy tips, appointment reminders, and milestone alerts. These notifications are:

- **Generated entirely on your device** — no push notification servers are involved
- **Controlled by you** — choose from three levels (Minimal, Balanced, Everything) or disable entirely
- Customizable at any time in Settings

No notification data is transmitted off your device.

</div>

## Calendar Access

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Calendar Integration

If you choose to sync appointments with your device calendar, the app uses Apple's EventKit framework to create calendar events. This requires your explicit permission and only writes events you choose to add. We do not read or access other calendar entries.

</div>

## Photo Access

<div class="card" markdown="1">

### Optional Photo Library

If you attach photos to milestones or notes, the app accesses your photo library with your permission. Photos are stored locally within the app's data container and are not uploaded anywhere.

</div>

## Data Backup & Export

The app includes a built-in backup feature that exports your data as a JSON file. This file is created locally and shared only through methods you choose (AirDrop, Files, email, etc.). We never see or access these backups.

## Third-Party Services

**We use zero third-party services.** No analytics (no Firebase, no Mixpanel), no crash reporting, no advertising networks, no server APIs. The app is entirely self-contained.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for expecting parents and their support partners.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, and device encryption). We recommend keeping your device software up to date.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
