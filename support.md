<p class="page-subtitle">Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting</p>

## Getting Started

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I set up the app?**

When you first open the app, you'll be guided through a quick onboarding flow:

1. Choose your role — **Primary User** (starting a new tracker) or **Join Partner** (connecting to an existing tracker via invite link)
2. Enter your name (or how you'd like to be greeted)
3. Set your due date (primary user) or paste the invite link (partner)
4. Optionally add your baby's name and gender
5. Choose your notification preference (Minimal, Balanced, or Everything)

You can change any of these later in **Settings**.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**I just found out I'm pregnant — will the app work for me?**

Yes! BumpTrackr is designed for every stage, from the earliest weeks through delivery and beyond into baby's first days. The app adapts its content, checklists, and tips based on where you are.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**My due date changed — how do I update it?**

Go to **Settings** (the gear icon) and tap the **Due Date** field. All your weekly data, tips, and progress will update automatically.

</div>

## Features

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**What is the weekly tip card?**

The home screen shows a tip card tailored to your current week. These cover important milestones like screening windows, vaccination timing, when to pack your hospital bag, and signs of labor.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How does the checklist work?**

The checklist provides recommended to-dos organized by category. During pregnancy, items are grouped by trimester (First Trimester, Second Trimester, Hospital Bag, Nursery, etc.). After delivery, the checklist transforms into newborn care categories — Feeding, Sleep & Routine, Health & Safety, Admin & Insurance, and Self-Care. You can also add your own custom items at any stage. Pregnancy items are preserved when you transition to postpartum mode.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I track kicks?**

Starting around week 20, the Symptoms tab shows a kick counter. Tap the "Kick" button each time you feel movement. The app tracks your daily count with a goal of 10 kicks per day, and shows a weekly trend chart.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How does the contraction timer work?**

From the Symptoms tab, tap the "Contraction" button to open the full-screen timer. Tap Start when a contraction begins and Stop when it ends. The app tracks count, average duration, and average interval. A guidance banner explains when to call your provider.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Can I share my birth plan?**

Yes! Once you've filled out your birth plan, tap the share button to export it as a formatted document you can send to your partner, doula, or care provider.

</div>

## Partner Sync

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I share with my partner?**

1. Go to **Settings → Partner Sync**
2. Tap **Invite Partner** — this creates a share link
3. Send the link to your partner via Messages, AirDrop, or any method
4. Your partner opens BumpTrackr and taps **Join Partner** during onboarding (or goes to **Settings → Partner Sync → Join via Link**)
5. Both devices now sync pregnancy data in real time via iCloud

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**What data syncs between partners?**

Checklist items, appointments, symptom logs, milestones, baby shower details, birth plan, and critical contacts all sync between paired devices. Each entry is labeled with who logged it (your display name). Photos, journal notes, and app preferences (theme, notifications) are per-device and do not sync.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I remove a partner or stop sharing?**

- **Owner** (person who created the share): Go to Settings → Partner Sync → Stop Sharing, or remove individual participants
- **Partner** (person who accepted the invite): Go to Settings → Partner Sync → Leave Shared Tracker

Leaving immediately revokes access. No data is deleted from either device — each person keeps their local copy.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Sync seems delayed — what should I do?**

CloudKit sync depends on network conditions and iCloud availability. Try:

1. Make sure both devices are connected to the internet
2. Open the app on both devices (sync triggers on launch and when returning to the app)
3. Pull to refresh on the Home, Checklist, or Appointments tab
4. Go to Settings → Partner Sync and tap **Force Refresh All Data**
5. Check that iCloud is enabled: Settings → Apple Account → iCloud → Apps Using iCloud

Sync typically completes within a few seconds but may take up to a minute on slower connections.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**My partner can't open the share link**

- Make sure BumpTrackr is installed on your partner's device
- Both devices must be signed in to iCloud with different Apple IDs
- Check that iCloud Drive is enabled on both devices
- Try generating a new invite link if the original has expired

</div>

## Labor Mode & Delivery

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**What is Labor Mode?**

Starting at week 37, a "Enter Labor Mode" button appears on the home screen. This opens a full-screen view with:

- A **contraction timer** for timing contractions during labor
- A **birth plan summary** (read-only) so your preferences are at hand
- Your **critical contacts** with quick-dial buttons

Labor Mode is designed to be used during active labor when you need quick access to essential information.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I record the delivery?**

When baby arrives, tap "Baby Has Arrived!" on the home screen (available from week 37+). You'll walk through a quick flow to record:

1. Birth date and time
2. Baby's weight and length
3. Baby's name confirmation

After recording, the entire app transforms into **postpartum mode** with baby care tools, recovery tracking, and newborn-focused checklists.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Can I go back to pregnancy mode?**

Yes — if you entered delivery details by mistake, go to **Settings** and tap "Return to Pregnancy Mode" at the bottom to undo the transition.

</div>

## Smart Notifications

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do notifications work?**

BumpTrackr sends local notifications (generated entirely on your device) for weekly tips, appointment reminders, and milestone alerts. You can choose from three levels:

- **Minimal** — Only essential reminders (appointments, critical milestones)
- **Balanced** — Weekly tips plus important reminders
- **Everything** — All available notifications including engagement prompts

Change your preference anytime in **Settings → Notification Frequency**.

</div>

## Data & Privacy

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Where is my data stored?**

All data is stored **locally on your device** and synced via your personal **iCloud account**. We don't operate any servers. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy) for full details.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I back up my data?**

Go to **Settings → Backup & Restore**. Tap "Export to JSON" to create a backup file you can save to iCloud Drive, Files, or share via AirDrop.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Can I transfer data to a new phone?**

Yes — since data syncs via iCloud, simply sign in to the same Apple ID on your new device and install BumpTrackr. Your data will sync automatically. You can also export a manual backup on your old device and import it on your new device using the **Backup & Restore** screen.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**What happens if I delete the app?**

Locally stored data is permanently removed. iCloud data can be managed separately via Settings → Apple Account → iCloud → Manage Storage. If sharing was active, your partner keeps their local copy of the data.

</div>

## Troubleshooting

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**The app shows "Week 1" but I'm further along**

Make sure your due date is set correctly in **Settings**. The week number is calculated from your due date — if the due date is too far in the future, the week number will appear low.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**My pregnancy facts show "No data available"**

The app includes medical facts for weeks 4–42. If you're in weeks 1–3, a brief message will appear instead. This is normal — detailed development data begins at week 4.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Calendar sync isn't working**

1. Go to **iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars**
2. Make sure BumpTrackr has permission
3. Try toggling the permission off and back on
4. Re-add the appointment from within the app

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**The app seems slow or unresponsive**

- Make sure your device is running iOS 17 or later
- Try closing and reopening the app
- Restart your device if issues persist

</div>
