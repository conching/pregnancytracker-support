<p class="page-subtitle">Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting</p>

## Getting Started

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I set up the app?**

When you first open the app, you'll be guided through a quick onboarding flow:

1. Enter your name (or how you'd like to be greeted)
2. Set your due date
3. Optionally add your baby's name and gender

You can change any of these later in **Settings**.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**I just found out I'm pregnant — will the app work for me?**

Yes! BumpTrackr is designed for every stage, from the earliest weeks through delivery. The app adapts its content, checklists, and tips based on how far along you are.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**My due date changed — how do I update it?**

Go to **Settings** (the gear icon) and tap the **Due Date** field. All your weekly data, tips, and progress will update automatically.

</div>

## Features

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**What is the weekly tip card?**

The home screen shows a tip card tailored to your current week. These cover important milestones like screening windows, vaccination timing, when to pack your hospital bag, and signs of labor.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How does the checklist work?**

The checklist provides recommended to-dos organized by category (First Trimester, Second Trimester, Hospital Bag, Nursery, etc.). Items are sorted by relevance to your current stage. You can also add your own custom items.

**How do I track kicks?**

Starting around week 20, the Symptoms tab shows a kick counter. Tap the "Kick" button each time you feel movement. The app tracks your daily count with a goal of 10 kicks per day, and shows a weekly trend chart.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How does the contraction timer work?**

From the Symptoms tab, tap the "Contraction" button to open the full-screen timer. Tap Start when a contraction begins and Stop when it ends. The app tracks count, average duration, and average interval. A guidance banner explains when to call your provider.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Can I share my birth plan?**

Yes! Once you've filled out your birth plan, tap the share button to export it as a formatted document you can send to your partner, doula, or care provider.

</div>

## Data & Privacy

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Where is my data stored?**

All data is stored **locally on your device**. Nothing is sent to external servers. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy) for full details.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**How do I back up my data?**

Go to **Settings → Backup & Restore**. Tap "Export to JSON" to create a backup file you can save to iCloud Drive, Files, or share via AirDrop.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Can I transfer data to a new phone?**

Yes — export a backup on your old device, then import it on your new device using the same **Backup & Restore** screen.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**What happens if I delete the app?**

All data stored within the app will be permanently deleted. We recommend creating a backup first if you plan to reinstall later.

</div>

## Troubleshooting

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**The app shows "Week 1" but I'm further along**

Make sure your due date is set correctly in **Settings**. The week number is calculated from your due date — if the due date is too far in the future, the week number will appear low.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**My pregnancy facts show "No data available"**

The app includes medical facts for weeks 4–42. If you're in weeks 1–3, a brief message will appear instead. This is normal — detailed development data begins at week 4.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**Calendar sync isn't working**

1. Go to **iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars**
2. Make sure BumpTrackr has permission
3. Try toggling the permission off and back on
4. Re-add the appointment from within the app

</div>

<div class="card" markdown="1">

**The app seems slow or unresponsive**

- Make sure your device is running iOS 17 or later
- Try closing and reopening the app
- Restart your device if issues persist

</div>
